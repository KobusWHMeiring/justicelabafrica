            The justice gap in South Africa is significant. For millions, the legal system remains complex, expensive, and out of reach. We believe technology is the most scalable way to bridge that gap. Justice Lab Africa was founded on a simple principle: to build free, high-quality digital tools that empower ordinary people to understand and enforce their rights.
